        Welcome to the site of Gabriella Elizondo. I have an incredible idea for
        my pet project but I am affraid to share it as I feel like its a pretty
        dope idea. The app has already been done However, I have ideas that
        would make it so much cooler. For now, how about we just have a small
        introduction.

      <h3>Take a peak at what I'm working on:</h3>
      <form>
        <input
          type="search"
          placeholder="Type your city..."
          class="form-control"
          id="city-input"
          autocomplete="off"
        />
        <input type="submit" value="Search" class="btn btn-primary w-100" />
      </form>
      <header id="city-input"></header>
      <div id="footer">
        <p>Are you curious or want to get involved in the process?</p>
