        Welcome to the site of Gabriella Elizondo. I have an incredible idea for
        my pet project but I am affraid to share it as I feel like its a pretty
        dope idea. The app has already been done However, I have ideas that
        would make it so much cooler. For now, how about we just have a small
        introduction.
